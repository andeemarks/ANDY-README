# About Andy
A document about me as a person and leader.  Recommended reading for people working with me.

## Why does this exist?
1. The creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values.
1. Hopefully this will help you understand me better and help us work together.

# What I value
* High quality code.  Understanding that high internal quality does not come at the expense of speed, it enables sustainable delivery at high speed.  Sometimes we go too far in our pursuit of high internal quality, but nowhere near as many times as we've not gone far enough.  If you don't care about this when writing hobbyist code, you wont care about it when writing code professionally (aka: "train as you mean to play")
* Taking pride in your work.  Life is too short to not take pride in work you are doing.  There will be a %age of work that is hopefully small and mundane, but I want to put you in a position where you are proud with what you've done.
* Delivering as a team.  The unit of delivery is the team.  Optimising for anything smaller than that is a waste of time.  
* Gaining knowledge to share knowledge.  Not only is sharing knowledge a great test for how well you understand something, it is a way each of us can use the privilege we have to make the world a better place, even in a small way.
* Sustainable work and life.  I don't live to work.  When I am at work, I'm 100% at work, but I try to switch off outside of that time.  Any environment that is predicated on people working unsustainably to survive is built on false foundations.
* Seeing colleagues grow.  I have a small %age of the DNA of a teacher in me and seeing colleagues grow their skills, increase their confidence and spread their wings (even if that makes leaving for better opportunities) is a wonderful feeling.
* Bringing simplicity.  I used to admire the people who promote themselves as "wanting to solve the hardest technical problems".  Now they scare me, and I'd rather make all hard problems easy.
* Personal health.  So much of life is easier/harder if we're not feeling healthy.  I get very grumpy if I don't get a chance to exercise in some form each day, even if it is just a brisk walk.  

# What I'm good at
* Self reflection
* Empathy
* Engineering efficiency
* Talk about tech (especially to non-tech folks)
* Listening
* Balanced opinions
* Feedback
* Visualisation (especially of technology)
* Public speaking

# What I'm working on
* Speaking up in loud/busy conversations.  I'm an introvert and will listen first, analyse second, then respond.
* Building confidence in opinions without practical experience.  I'm much happier if I've done the thing I'm talking about.
* Having many balls in the air simultaneously.  A bit of multi-tasking is ideal, a lot makes me very inefficient.

# Getting in touch
* Prefer face-to-face if possible, especially if we've not met before
* Chat is good
* Happy for you to contact me out of hours... I may/may not respond
* I may contact you out of hours... absolutely not looking for a response

# 1:1s
* These are for you.  I will always make time, but you drive the agenda.  Having an agenda is not necessary, but certainly helpful.

# Social conversation starters
* Outdoor stuff, especially walking/hiking and rock climbing.
* AFL/Essendon
* NBA.*
* Bass guitar
* Board games
*
